I'm a self taught developer and sys admin. I've been a janitor, and even installed some hurricane-proofing on a prison in Florida one summer. I've spent a great deal of my career working with Python, but I've brought myself up to speed on Golang, which is my main squeeze.

My big project is [genesis](https://ndumas.com/portfolio/genesis/), a procedural world generation toolkit focused on interactivity and iterative edits; I've written about this in [some depth](/posts/genesis-roadmap/), and this is my major passion project.

As a sysadmin, I don't write a lot of code for my work. Mostly quick bash and python scripts to do data munging and minor automation stuff. Puppet and Saltstack handle most of the heavy lifting. This gives me time to expand my portfolio and work on [brainfuck interpreters](https://github.com/therealfakemoot/go-fuck) and porting [python utilities](https://github.com/therealfakemoot/go-collections) to go.
