# Genesis

Genesis is a toolkit for creative world design; it offers both procedural and manual means of creating and modifying the geography, climate, political/economic, and structural characteristics of a given world. Uses can allow automatic generation to take over for the entirety of the world's attributes, or they can step in at one of several discrete phases making modifications to suit their needs.

# SLAyer

SLAyer is a toolkit used to enforce service level agreements on collections of tickets. It supports multiple ticketing systems including Jira, Github,  and Gitlab as well as offering a simple API for exposing other custom ticket systems; if desired, emacs' org-mode, `// TODO` comments in source code, or other such arbitrary collections of "task"-like data can be analyzed and reported on.

# Perminator

Perminator was designed to change file permissions according to user designed rules. This originally started as a replacement for an in-house utility at a web hosting company written in Python that was 1) very slow and 2) made hard-coded assumptions about the changes it was making.

# go-quantize

Quantization is the process of translating a a known range of inputs into a discrete output space. One of the primary uses of quantization is in signal processing as a form of compression.
