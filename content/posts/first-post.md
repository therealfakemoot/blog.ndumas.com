# Introduction
I've been programming with a passion for the last 15 years. I started with Python 2.2 or so and stuck with that for a good while, I also spent a few years doing web development work and most recently added Golang to my kit.

# This Site
This site is going to be a portfolio/showroom for my projects. I'll try to find clever ways to interact with my tools through the browser to take advantage of the optimizations and growing array of high power tools being baked into browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

A section of this site will also be used for my streaming content and tools. I've finished the first prototype of my [idle screen](http://idle.ndumas.com) which will continue to get polished.

## Tech
Shoutout to [jcmdln](https://github.com/jcmdln) for the CSS framework, `yttrium`. I'll try to do it justice in making a site that doesn't look a mess.
