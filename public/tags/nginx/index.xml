      <description>SELinux DigitalOcean&amp;rsquo;s Fedora droplets include SELinux. I don&amp;rsquo;t know a great deal about SELinux but it&amp;rsquo;s presumably a good thing for helping prevent privilege escalations and so on. Unfortunately, it can be troublesome when trying to do simple static site stuff with nginx.
nginx With Fedora and nginx and selinux all in use simultaneously, you are allowed to tell nginx to serve files that are owned/grouped under a user other than nginx&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>The Reveal It took me way longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit but I finally discovered why I was not able to properly reverse proxy a subdomain ( git.ndumas.com ). As it turns out, SELinux was the culprit. I wanted to write a short post about this partly to reinforce my own memory and maybe to make this sort of thing easier to find for others encountering &amp;lsquo;mysterious&amp;rsquo; issues when operating on SELinux Fedora installations like Digital Ocean droplets.</description>
