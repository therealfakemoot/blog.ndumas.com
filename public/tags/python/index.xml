      <description>Recently, I was working on an idea for a MUD; the general idea was to build a game with detailed &amp;lsquo;inhabited&amp;rsquo; areas such as cities and dungeons as well as expansive wilderness regions for exploring and claiming by players. Naturally, I realized that doing this by hand would be unbearably tedious. A semi-realistic MUD world could contain 4,000,000 rooms; manually creating &amp;ldquo;Meadowy Plains #1421&amp;rdquo; would be error-prone and would drain the creative ability of a human.</description>
